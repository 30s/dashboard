##Our development process

Some of the core team will be working directly on Github. We will reviewing all pull requests and accepting them as soon as possible.

### `master` is unsafe

We will keep `master` in good shape. That means you are not able to push master directly. Netbeast dev team will update master once pull request have been sucessful

### Test your code

Before creating a pull resquest please be sure your code passes all the test we have been coding. Once you have finished coding you only need to run this code:

```
npm test
```

If everything goes successfully you are able to create the pull request.

### Pull Requests

Netbeast development team will be monitoring for PR(pull requests). Once people create a pull request travis will test your code. If this process is sucessfull we will merge your PR.

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
4. If you are solving a bug problem posted on issues with your PR, comment your solution on it.

## Bugs


### Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. Please always you report a bug write some code to show the problem and if it is possible tell us how to replicate your bug.
